Here’s an **agentic, keyword-focused workflow** for your platform, designed for automation and minimal user friction (with each step as a “task” to chain or trigger):

***

**Agentic Workflow (Keywords First):**

1. **Platform Entry (User or Agent):**  
   Open homepage → Prompt clearly for `Keyword Discovery` (primary action).

2. **Keyword Discovery Task:**  
   - Agent prompts: “Enter keywords to find companies/prospects.”
   - User/agent inputs keywords (e.g., “SaaS startups,” “nonprofits,” etc.).
   - Agent launches auto-search using those keywords (with a scalable API/search strategy).

3. **Prospect Identification:**  
   - Agent compiles a list of companies/websites based on results.
   - Agent auto-calculates ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) scores for ranking relevance.

4. **Selection & Audit Trigger:**  
   - Agent displays prospects ranked by ICP.
   - Each prospect has a “Scan Now” button.
   - User or agent triggers audit for any or all prospects (could be batched or user-selected).

5. **Automated WCAG Audit:**  
   - Agent runs accessibility audit workflow in the background.
   - For each site:  
     - Generate before/after mockups.
     - Summarize major non-compliance points.
     - Score and categorize issues automatically.

6. **Automated Output Generation:**  
   - Agent bundles a report:  
     - PDF summary of results.  
     - HTML/CSS code packages for fixes.
   - Agent serves download links or auto-sends these bundles via webhook/email/API.

7. **Alternative Path:**  
   For users with a specific site:  
   - “Quick Win Audit by URL” secondary flow (less prominent), same audit automation as above but with manual URL input.

8. **Agentic Loops:**  
   - Every stage can have triggers for follow-up actions:
     - Re-run audit on regular intervals.
     - Launch outreach campaigns to discovered prospects.
     - Auto-enrich results with additional third-party data.
   - All steps expose hooks for further LLM/agent orchestration.

***

**Key Design Principles:**  
- **Keyword Discovery = primary action**
- **Background processing & auto-triggering** as much as possible
- **Every step exposes an API/action endpoint** (enabling agent chaining)
- **Minimal manual input:** Only at keyword entry or (optionally) URL entry

**Summary Table**

| Step                    | Agentic Action                                                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Homepage Load           | Prompt for keyword input                                              |
| Keyword Entry           | Auto-lookup prospects, score ICP                                      |
| Prospect List           | Present “Scan Now” for each; allow agent-initiated bulk scan          |
| Run Audit               | Agent performs tests, generates reports+fixes automatically           |
| Output                  | Auto-generate downloads, send via webhook or API as needed            |
| Quick Win (Alt. path)   | Manual URL audit, same automated report gen                           |

**Agentic Focus:**  
Every task can be triggered by an **agent or workflow script**, not just the end user. The platform is fully “agent-ready” for chaining, automation, and hands-off operation.
